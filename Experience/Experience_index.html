	Chronological list of work experience
	
	<h2> NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL </h2>
	<p> <i> Structural Dynamics Analysis and Testing for SLS Intern </i> </p>
	<p> August 2017 - May 2018 </p>
	<p> Translated tools for video analysis of small motions from MatLab to Python. Developed and implemented Python image analysis software tools in order to
observe structural testing of a cylinder in compression to support the Shell Buckling Knockdown Factor (SBKF) program. Utilized Python video analysis tools to
retrieve natural mode shapes and mode frequencies of large structures from video of modal tests, then amplified motion to make modes more apparent in video.
Used commercially available stereo cameras as well as basic, two-camera setups to produce depth maps, perform modal analysis, and magnify out-of-plane
motion. Learned and utilized common industry Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tools such as NASTRAN, PATRAN, and FEMAP to perform modal analysis of finite
element models. Assisted senior engineers with performing sensitivity studies on finite element models, such as the Space Launch System (SLS) Core stage
modal test. Volunteered for community outreach and fundraising events held by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.

	<h2> Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Laboratory, Minneapolis, MN </h2>
	<p> <i> Undergraduate Research Assistant </i> </p>
	<p> June 2016 - August 2017 </p>
	<p> Collected thrust test data for wind tunnel testing and analyzed results using MatLab in support of motor selection for a large, aeroelastic wing. Performed
comprehensive evaluation of commercial servo properties and capabilities, such as voltage requirements, maximum torque, speed, and deadband, using an
Arduino to drive each servo and MatLab to analyze results, to inform purchasing decisions for an aeroelastic wing. Developed programs for computer vision
analysis of test flights where the wing is subject to large bending moments using OpenCV-Python bindings in order to quantify displacement of the wing tip.
Revised and updated models of aircraft controls systems using Simulink in order to perform computer simulations of new flight hardware and software in support
of the new flight computer, Goldy 3. Learned and used the aircraft geometry and analysis tool OpenVSP to perform control surface derivative aerodynamic
analysis for basic flights and parsed results using MatLab. Designed and fabricated an unmanned aerial vehicle using principles of flight to reduce stall speed by
20%. Defined and delivered a set of flight test procedures that would ensure sufficient data acquisition. Conducted flight testing on the unmanned aerial vehicle,
analyzed data, and presented results in a formal, written report.

	<h2> Minnesota Space Grant Consortium Stratospheric Ballooning, Minneapolis, MN </h2>
	<p> <i> Undergraduate Research Assistant </i> </p>
	<p> May 2017 - September 2017 </p>
	<p> Improved Arduino training methods for an all-Freshman class to introduce new engineers to stratospheric ballooning. Led and volunteered to facilitate
workshops for K-12 students to encourage interest in STEM fields. Designed a telemetry payload to secure and organize an eight-camera multiplexer to stream
video of a stratospheric balloon flight. Planned and led the set-up and launch of one out of five telemetry-enabled, stratospheric balloons during the total solar
eclipse on August 21, 2017. Presented results from the University of Minnesota's Space Grant Ballooning Team's eclipse launch at the National Space Grant
Meeting.
